Responsible AI Toolbox is a suite of tools providing a collection of model and data exploration and assessment user
interfaces and libraries that enable a better understanding of AI systems. These interfaces and libraries empower
developers and stakeholders of AI systems to develop and monitor AI more responsibly, and take better data-driven
actions.

## Contributions

- **Model Evaluation**: Added model evaluation tools for generative text models, including metrics like coherence,
equivalence, fluency, groundedness, and relevance with a GPT-4 backend.
- **Output Explanation**: Developed a tool for explaining outputs of black-box generative text models by implementing
explainers developed by Microsoft Research.
