We propose a new MDP for sepsis treatment in the ICU built using medical data from real patients. The MDP is built using data from the MIMIC-III database and is designed to be used as a standard benchmark for evaluating new RL algorithms. We evaluate the performance of a few RL algorithms on the proposed benchmark and show that the proposed environment is challenging even for state-of-the-art RL algorithms. We are releasing the code for the environment to facilitate further research in this area.
