I am Kartik Choudhary - incoming graduate student in the College of Information and Computer Science at the University 
of Massachusetts Amherst. My interests include Natural Language Processing and Reinforcement Learning. Specifically, 
I want to build tools that make technology more accessible and universal. I love basketball, reading fantasy novels,
casual astrophysics, and EDM.
