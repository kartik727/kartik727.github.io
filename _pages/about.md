I am Kartik Choudhary - graduate student in the [College of Information and Computer Science](https://www.cics.umass.edu/) at the [University of Massachusetts Amherst](https://www.umass.edu/). My interests include natural language processing and reinforcement learning, and their applications in AI safety and interpretability.

Currently I am looking for internships in Data Science and Machine Learning roles for the Summer of 2023 within the US. I also love playing basketball, reading fantasy novels, casual astrophysics, and playing CS:GO.
